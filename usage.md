# Usage

## Git
To start off, you'll need Git. If you already have it, you can skip this step. If not, go download the latest version for your operating system [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Open up powershell / command prompt in a folder (doesn't have to be empty) and paste the following:

`git clone https://github.com/zurrty/mooliobot2.git`

This will pull all of the source code from here and put it in a nice little folder for convenience.

This tool will also allow you to contribute your code to the project.

## IDE's
download one of these
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (Highly recommended)
## Node & Yarn
Now that you have Git and an IDE installed, lets get the thing running
